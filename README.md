These adapters allow you to connect a logic analyzer to the CERBERUS 2100 expansion port--while having an expansion board connected.

## One-To-One Adapter (Rev 1 Ready)
The One-to-one has three connectors. The middle connector plugs into the CERBERUS 2100's socket. The left header is intended for a logic analyzer. The right header is intended for an expansion board.

However, all three headers are connected in parallel.
