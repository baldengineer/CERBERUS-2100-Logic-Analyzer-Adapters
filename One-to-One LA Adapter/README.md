![One-to-One Adapter Bottom](One-to-One%20LA%20Adapter/One-to-One%20LA%20Adapter%20bottom%20angled%20rev1.jpg)

The One-to-one has three connectors. The middle connector plugs into the CERBERUS 2100's socket. The left header is intended for a logic analyzer. The right header is intended for an expansion board.

However, all three headers are connected in parallel.

### Status
Rev1 sent to fab. Still need to make Waveforms template and test the boards.
