This adapter is inteded to be used with a Digilent Digital Discovery. (Not the Analog Discovery!)

The center connector plugs into the socket. The right connector is for an expansion card. The left connector is for the Digital Discovery. 

Three connection options:
1. Use a short ribbon cable.
2. Mount the header upside-down.
3. Mount the header top-side-up.

### Status
Rev1 sent to fab. Still need to make Waveforms template and test the boards.
