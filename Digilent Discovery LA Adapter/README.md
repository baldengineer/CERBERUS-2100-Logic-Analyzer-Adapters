![words](image.jpg)

This adapter is inteded to be used with a Digilent Digital Discovery. (Not the Analog Discovery!)

The center connector plugs into the socket. The right connector is for an expansion card. The left connector is for the Digital Discovery. It is probably best to use a ribbon cable!
